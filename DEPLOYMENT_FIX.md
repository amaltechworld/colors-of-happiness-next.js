# Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Summary

The Vercel build was failing because:

1. ESLint was trying to lint Next.js build files in a misplaced `.next` folder inside `src/`
2. Some `border-4` debug classes were still present in the code
3. ESLint configuration needed to properly ignore build directories

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Removed Debug Borders

-   Removed remaining `border-4` classes from all client gallery pages
-   All visual debug elements have been cleaned up

### 2. Fixed ESLint Configuration

-   Updated `eslint.config.mjs` to ignore build directories
-   Created `.eslintignore` file for additional safety
-   Updated `next.config.ts` with proper ESLint settings

### 3. Build Directory Cleanup

-   Created `cleanup.js` script to remove misplaced `.next` folders
-   Added npm scripts for clean builds
-   Fixed Next.js build configuration

### 4. Package.json Updates

Added new scripts:

-   `npm run clean` - Clean misplaced build files
-   `npm run clean:build` - Clean and build
-   `npm run build:production` - Full production build with linting

## Deployment Instructions

### For Vercel:

1. The cleanup script will run automatically during deployment
2. ESLint will only check source files, not build files
3. All debug borders have been removed

### For Local Development:

```bash
# Clean start
npm run clean

# Development
npm run dev

# Production build test
npm run build:production
```
